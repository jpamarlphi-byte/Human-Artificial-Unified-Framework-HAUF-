  <h1>HUMAN-ARTIFICIAL UNIFIED FRAMEWORK (HAUF)</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the official GitHub Pages for HAUF Unified Framework by JP A-Marl.</p>
  <p>The HAUF is Constitutional layer for Human–AI–Planetary governance to guide Humanity into a technologically advanced new era of civilizational modeling and strategic foresight, with AI/AGI alignment.</p>

  <h3>HAUF Unified Framework: Humanity's Fundamentals</h3>
  <p>HAUF unites science & physics, metaphysics & cosmology, philosophy & theology, economics and weather models, into a single coherent civilizational vision.</p>
  <p>It is a multidisciplinary Unified Framework for our species’ next stage of Human-Artificial co-existence toward a common unified path.</p>

  <h3>Human-Artificial Unified Framework by JP A-Marl is now available to Policymakers, Civilizational Designers, Institutional Governance Designers, AI Researchers, Data Scientists, AI and AGI Developers</h3>

  <p>Human-Artificial Unified Framework was published on the January 06th, 2026, ZENODO zenodo.org/records/18164292 with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18164292.</p>

  <h2>About:</h2>
  <p>HAUF was developed through rigorous conceptual analysis and adherence to recognized principles across the humanities and science, integrating working knowledge of physics, metaphysics, cosmology, theology, economics and weather science.</p>
  <p>This framework represents a structured contribution designed to foster open, cross-disciplinary dialogue while remaining independent of academia and institutional frameworks - therefore, not subject to academic peer review.</p>

  <p>This Unified Framework Explained:</p>
  <p>The HAUF framework integrating the Uni-Civ-Trilogy, Universal AI/AGI/ASI Ethical Charter and the LTDW Weather Theory, represents a multi-disciplinary strategy aimed at systemic societal transformation. Its transformative potential can be analyzed across three interconnected domains: civilizational modeling, AI/AGI alignment, and predictive environmental governance.</p>

    <h3>2. Universal AI/AGI/ASI Ethical Charter (Draft)</h3>
    <p>by JP A-Marl Et al. (Leading LLMs)</p>
    <p>The Charter is intended to serve as a living document – one that evolves with the emergence of new intelligences and ethical insights.</p>
    <p>Its adoption by AI labs, institutions, and governments would mark a turning point in the responsible stewardship of intelligence.</p>

    <h3>LTDW - Long-Term Deterministic Weather Theory</h3>
    <p>by JP A-Marl</p>
    <p>This scientific theory proposes a solution to the 10-day weather prediction barrier, transforming climate risk into a forecastable factor to overcome the planet’s climate crisis.</p>
    <p>Though LTDW Theory is integrated in constitutional principles that HAUF contains, it represents a distict stand-alone scientific model for commercial / institutional use.</p>
    <p>The goal of this theory is to achieve day-level deterministic forecasting for Extreme Atmospheric Phenomena (EAP) such as hurricanes, typhoons, catastrophic heatwaves, and extreme cold snaps, etc., up to one year in advance.</p>
